## Cryptography - Breaking the One-time Pad

You've been able to intercept the following message from an encrypted channel that used the one-time pad as encryption method:

The only additional information you know about it is that itâ€™s been encoded using base64, and that the length of the key used for one-time pad was 6.
Your job is to retrieve the original key and decrypt the message.
