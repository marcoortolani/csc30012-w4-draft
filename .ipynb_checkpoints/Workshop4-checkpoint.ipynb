    "## Cryptography - Breaking the One-time Pad\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise aims at getting a practical understanding of the principles behind (symmetric) cryptography by attempting to break one of the simplest cyphers: the one-time pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is theoretically impossible to break this cypher, as it can be proven that it does achieve perfect secrecy. However, recall that the effectiveness of the cypher relies entirely on the fact that the key is used only once. When the key is shorter than the plain text, it will necessarily be used more than once, thus weakening the cypher.\n",

    "The only additional information you know about it is that it’s been encoded using base64, and that the length of the key used for one-time pad was 6.\n",

    "In Python, strings are simply created by eclosing characters into (single or double) quotes: ```str = 'foobar'```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefixing a string literal with ```b``` produces an instance of the _bytes_ type instead of the _string_ type: ```str = b'foobar'``` which effectively corresponds to the representation of that string in 8-bit ASCII code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### base64\n",
    "Unfortunately, besides all the alphanumeric symbols, the ASCII code contains many control characters. If you were to interpret any sequence of bits transmitted across the network as an ASCII code, the binary sequence might inadvertently contain control codes that would muddle the transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative code (used for example in e-mail protocols) is **base64**, which splits the binary sequence in groups of **6 bits** that may always be represented using _printable_ characters. (The garbled sequence of characters that you see if you open an email with attachments with a text editor is exactly the base64 encoding of the attachment).\n",

    "In Python, we can use the encoding/decoding methods provided by the ```base64``` package, as shown below.\n",
